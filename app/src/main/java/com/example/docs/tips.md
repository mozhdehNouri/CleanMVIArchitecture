If you already work with compose you face this challenge
Which one we should use in ViewModel? StateFlow or compose State
As you know HotFlow and compose State(mutableStateOf()) are Reactive which
means the program reacts
to data or event changes instead of requesting information about changes.
When we call stateFlow from ViewModel in a compose function we use the
collectAsStateWithLifecycle
extension function.
How does it work internally?
collectAsStateWithLifecycle is a composable function that collects values
from a flow and represents
the latest value as Compose State in a lifecycle-aware manner. Every time
a new flow emission
occurs, the value of this State object updates.
By default, collectAsStateWithLifecycle uses Lifecycle.State.STARTED to
start and stop collecting
values from the flow. This occurs when the Lifecycle moves in and out of
the target state.
You can move the lifecycle with the minActiveState parameter

```kt
@Composable
fun <T> StateFlow<T>.collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
    lifecycleOwner: LifecycleOwner = LocalLifecycleOwner.current,
    minActiveState: Lifecycle.State = Lifecycle.State.STARTED,
    context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext
): State<T> = collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
        initialValue = this.value,
        lifecycle = lifecycleOwner.lifecycle,
        minActiveState = minActiveState,
        context = context
    )
collectAsStateWithLifecycle uses produceState to convert flow to a compose state
        @Composable
        fun <T> Flow<T>.collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
            initialValue: T,
            lifecycle: Lifecycle,
            minActiveState: Lifecycle.State = Lifecycle.State.STARTED,
            context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext
        ): State<T> {
            return produceState(
                initialValue,
                this,
                lifecycle,
                minActiveState,
                context
            ) {
                lifecycle.repeatOnLifecycle(minActiveState) {
                    if (context == EmptyCoroutineContext) {
                        this@collectAsStateWithLifecycle.collect {
                            this@produceState.value = it
                        }
                    } else withContext(context) {
                        this@collectAsStateWithLifecycle.collect {
                            this@produceState.value = it
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } }
}
```

Now as we know when a user navigates another screen flow stops collecting
because of the use
lifecycle internally.

Why do we need to use flow instead of compose state inside ViewModel :
ViewModel should be independent of UI. It is not a good choice to use
Compose in VM.
MutableStateFlowis multi-thread safe. You can use
MutableStateFlow.update{} to update it in any
thread or any coroutine context. However,mutableStateOf is not.
Now My question is :
What happens about the Lifecycle when we use compose State (
mutableStateOf() ) in ViewModel?
First, we should check the viewModel lifecycle in the compose
So as the document says: To use a ViewModel in Compose, you can pass the
lifecycleOwner parameter to
the ViewModel constructor. The lifecycleOwner will keep track of the
lifecycle of the composable and
will ensure that the ViewModel is only active when the composable is
visible.
For instance :
You can use navigation, which is perfect for your needs, each route has
its own view model scope,
which is destroyed as soon as the route is removed from the navigation
back stack.
Or you can use DisposableEffect for free viewModel when the screen isn't
active anymore...
So if you use compose State in ViewModel don't forget to consider the
state lifecycle
